# Support-Vector-Machine

A machine learning project demonstrating the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
The model is trained to separate data points using an optimal hyperplane and tested with different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, and RBF).
Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of decision boundaries.
